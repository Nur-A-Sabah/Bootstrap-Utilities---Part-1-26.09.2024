      Doraemon (ドラえもん) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated
      by Fujiko F. Fujio. First serialized in 1969, the manga's chapters were
      collected in 45 tankōbon volumes published by Shogakukan from 1974 to
      1996. The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who
      travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy named Nobita Nobi.

      Doraemon (ドラえもん) is the title character and co-protagonist of the
      series. He is a cat-like robot from the future. He was yellow-skinned and
      had ears originally. However, his ears were accidentally eaten by a
      robotic mouse. It left him heartbroken and caused his skin to turn blue.
      People often mistake him for a raccoon dog. He is sent back in time by
      Sewashi (Nobita's great-great-grandson) to help Nobita. Doraemon possesses
      a 4-dimensional pocket from which he can acquire various kinds of
      futuristic tools, gadgets, and playthings from a future department store.
      He has the tendency to panic during emergencies, characterized by him
      frantically trying to pull out a very much-needed tool from his pocket,
      only to produce a huge assortment of household items and unwanted gadgets.
      Still, Doraemon is very friendly and intelligent, not to mention
      long-suffering because of Nobita's antics. Since Sewashi sent Doraemon to
      the past, Doraemon has been living as the unofficial fourth member of
      Nobita's family and acts like a second son to Nobita's parents, since
      despite being a robot, he still needs to eat and sleep. He fears mice
      greatly (due to a robot mouse having eaten his ears); when confronted with
      mice he is liable to react by pulling out devastating gadgets. Most of the
      times, Nobita saves Doraemon in such situations. Although he has no
      fingers in most media(Although sometimes bumps looking like fingers are
      shown in his round hands), he can hold things because of the suction cups
      in his hands. His favorite food is Dorayaki or Doracake. He has been shown
      to date a normal female cat called Mi Chan. He is the elder brother of
      Dorami, another robot from the future, who is not more, is at least as
      smart as doraemon. She is also more sincere and calm. She has a bow tie
      instead of years.

      Nobita Nobi (野比 のび太, Nobi Nobita) is the co-protagonist of the
      series. He wears glasses, a red or yellow polo shirt with a white collar,
      and blue or black shorts and white socks and light blue shoes. Although
      he's not good at sports, he's good at shooting and has been reflected in
      the movies many time. He's also good at string figure which sometime
      considered a girl's game. Son of Tamako and Nobisuke Nobi. Future father
      of Nobisuke (his son). Future husband or boyfriend of Shizuka and
      great-great-grandfather of Sewashi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobita Nobi is a fictional character in the Doraemon anime and manga
      series created by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of writing team Hiroshi
      Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. He is also the main character in The Doraemons
      (special version). Known as Sidney, Nobi Nobi and Noby in some English
      localizations of the anime, Nobita is usually depicted as an elementary
      school student. His parents are Nobisuke and Tamako Nobi, and he is
      perpetually looked after by Doraemon, a robotic cat from the future sent
      back in time by Nobita's descendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with Doraemon, Nobita is considered to be one of the most popular
      and widely recognizable manga characters due to the series' popularity,
      which extends beyond its native Japan.

    <h2>Shizuka Minamoto</h2>
    <img

    <br /><br />
    <p>
      Shizuka Minamoto (源 静香, Minamoto Shizuka), nicknamed Shizuka-chan
      (しずかちゃん) is a smart, kind and pretty girl. She is often represented
      by the colour pink, and is seen wearing a pink shirt and skirt. The word
      'Shizuka (しずか)' means 'Quiet'. She is Nobita's best friend and
      love-interest. She does not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy
      disposition or constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage
      him to do better, though she usually fails to convince him. Shizuka likes
      to bathe several times a day; however, a running gag in the series is that
      she is sometimes interrupted by a sudden appearance of Nobita (sometimes
      Doraemon, Gian, or Suneo) usually due to misuse of Doraemon's gadgets like
      the Anywhere Door (Doko Demo Doa in Japanese). Shizuka's skirt is also
      frequently seen getting flipped, either by Nobita misusing Doraemon's
      gadgets, or by the wind. Scenes in which her underwear is seen, or she is
      seen bathing, have been removed from the dubbed versions, especially in
      India, Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom. Her true passions
      are sweet potatoes, which she would rather keep to herself, and the
      violin, for which her playing is just as horrendous as Gian's singing. She
      is also known for taking piano lessons reluctantly due to her mother's
      wishes (as she loves violin more), which is sometimes a reason for
      declining to hang out with friends (but she plays the piano better than
      the violin). Shizuka is an animal lover and keeps two pets at home: a dog,
      who is saved from succumbing to illness by Nobita and Doraemon in one
      story; and a canary which runs away on multiple occasions and causes
      Shizuka and Nobita to run around the city chasing it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sometimes fancies handsome idols on TV. Besides Nobita, Shizuka is
      also close to her classmate and popular student Dekisugi, though they
      consider each other only as friends.

    <h2>Takeshi "Gian" Goda</h2>

    />
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      Takeshi Goda (剛田 武, Gōda Takeshi) usually known by the nickname "Gian"
      (「ジャイアン」, "Jaian", English: Big G) is a strong and quick-tempered
      local bully. He frequently steals other children's stuff (especially
      Nobita's and Suneo's) under the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the
      toy is damaged. He is known for his awful singing voice, though he
      considers himself a great singer. To prove this, Gian sometimes "invites"
      others to attend his concerts, under the threat of beatings. His singing
      is so horrible that it causes nausea in listeners; once when Nobita and
      Doraemon try to mute it in a silent world, Gian's writing of the lyrics on
      a board have the same nausea-causing effect. Though his voice is terrible,
      in one of the episodes it was shown that a girl liked his singing. In some
      films, his singing is enhanced to become an effective weapon (as in
      'Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas'). In some episodes when his
      voice is recorded and he hears the recording, he instantly denies it is
      his voice and threatens to beat up the person who sang his songs badly.
      Gian is also confident in cooking, but just like his singing, his
      hand-made food can be a nightmare for other people very easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Gian does not hesitate to help his friends when they are in real
      trouble. Throughout the series, particularly the films, he is often the
      one who voices the most concern and refuses to look away when there is a
      problem, in contrast to Suneo's cowardice. While he is described by others
      as daunting and intimidating, he is very sensitive and prone to crying
      when something touching happens, and he actually values his friends
      highly, a feeling which his friends sometimes reciprocate. Gian also has a
      soft spot for his younger sister, Jaiko, and usually tries to prevent her
      from getting into trouble, even if she can handle the situation herself.
      Gian is basically a bullying 'tsundere'.
    </p>
    <p>
      His catchphrase is "What's mine is mine. What's yours is also mine."
      (「俺の物は、俺のもの。お前の物も俺の物。」, "Ore no mono wa, ore no mono.
      Omae no mono mo ore no mono."), also known as Gianism (ジャイアニズム,
      Jaianizumu) in Japan (the Japanese band Nightmare have borrowed the term
      for their albums Gianism Best Ofs and Gianizm).

    <h2>Suneo Honekawa</h2>

    />
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫, Honekawa Suneo) is the fox-faced (inherited
      from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his material wealth before
      everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the stories start with Suneo showing
      off some new video game, toy or pet which evokes Nobita's envy. He is
      often seen with Gian, teasing Nobita. He also often pushes Nobita aside
      with silly excuses while he invites Gian and Shizuka to his parties or
      resorts. However, he is actually one of Nobita's closest friends, who
      would often ask for his and Doraemon's help. In the films, Suneo is often
      the one most reluctant to take part in Nobita and Doraemon's adventures,
      and he also tries to face as little trouble as possible and go home,
      unless others convince him, making him somewhat a coward. He has an
      extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer,
      besides being extremely cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at
      himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome
      guy in the world. His habit of bragging often lands him into trouble.
      Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid
      in his class. He likes steak and melon. Suneo often tries to win Shizuka's
      favour and is a close friend of Gian.
